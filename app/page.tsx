            <FrequentlyAskedQuestion
              question="is this a costume party?"
              answer="It sure can be!  Costumes are encouraged but most definitely optional.  Wear whatever you feel most comfortable in. Feel free to go ham-town on a costume. Feel free to channel your inner goth. Feel free to wear jeans (we mean it). Itâ€™s a night of drinking beer at a brewery on Halloween, thereâ€™s no need for a dress code lol."

              answer="Your kinders are cute and we love them but this is an evening event with no real entertainment planned other than yapping. Iâ€™m sure they would much rather be watching Hocus Pocus and indulging in the sweet results of their trick or treating. We kindly ask that the little ones stay home for this one. <br /> <br />TL;DR No :("

            <FrequentlyAskedQuestion
              question="do you have a gift registry?"
              answer="Nope! :) <br /> <br />We both lived solo before we met and we had to consolidate two apartments worth of stuff when we moved in together. Then we moved across the country twice and boy did that kick our butt in the stuff department. Your earthly presence and support are all we need."

                is the closest to the venue and within walking distance to
                Ossington, Parkdale and West Queen West neighbourhoods. Sonder
                Slate is closest to Union Station if you are taking the train.
                Please donâ€™t stay at the Liberty, Liberty Village is a garbage
                place.
